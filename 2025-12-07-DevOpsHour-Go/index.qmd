## Introduction

---

## What Makes Go Different

- Created at Google (2009) as a modern simple alternative to C
- Core philosophy: simplicity, readability, and pragmatism
- Key features overview: compiled, statically typed, garbage collected, built-in concurrency
- The "boring is good" principle - stability over novelty

---

## Why Go?

- Designed for modern software engineering challenges
  - Performance
  - Scalability
  - Security
  - Reliability

- Lean syntax &rarr; Easy to learn and use
- Strong standard library
- Built-in tools

---

## Go's Minimal Syntax

- ***

## All You Need Is STD

Go's extensive standard library includes everything you need[^*]:

- Logging: `log`, `log/slog`
- OS interactions: `os`
- File I/O: `io`
- Networking: `net/http`
- Databases: `database/sql`
- Data: `encoding/json`, `encoding/xml`, `encoding/csv`
- ... and much more

Bonus: the standard library is actually readable and an excellent resource for learning Go (take that, C++)

[^*]:
    until it doesn't, in which case Go still has an excellent package
    ecosystem. In any case, you should always start with just the standard library.

## The joy of having built-in tools

<!--TODO: contrast with Python, use python-tooling website screenshot-->

```shell
# Formatting
go fmt

# Testing
go test

# Compile & execute
go run

# Dependency management
go install
go get

# Docs generator
go doc
```

## A Note On Performance

## Go's DevOps Superpowers

- Fast build times & cross-compilation
- Small static binaries
- Low memory footprint and garbage collection
- Efficient concurrency
- Lends itself very well to microservices architecture

---

## Go in the Wild

- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Terraform
- The ARC TRE!

---

## How Go Is Used In The ARC TRE[^*]

Mainly to interface with SDKs (Software Development Kit):

- AWS: resource management at runtime
- Kubernetes

[^*]: **T**rusted **R**esearch **E**nvironment (TRE)

## Show Me Some Go Code Already

---

## When to Go (and when not to)

Typical [use cases](https://go.dev/solutions/use-cases):

- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
- Cloud & Network services
- DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
- Command-Line Interfaces (CLI)
- Web Development
