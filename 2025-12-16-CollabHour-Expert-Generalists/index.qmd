## What is an Expert Generalist?

> Someone who combines **broad knowledge** across multiple domains with **deep expertise** in several areas

- Not a shallow generalist, not a narrow specialist
- **Key abilities:**
  - Learn quickly
  - Recognize fundamental patterns beneath shifting tools
  - Apply insights across disciplines

---

## Beyond T-Shaped

![](https://martinfowler.com/articles/expert-generalist/t-shape.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

::: {.notes}
Traditional model: T-shaped people (one deep skill + broad knowledge)
Expert Generalists are more like **"combs"** or **"paint drips"**
Multiple areas of deep expertise with varying depths
:::

# Six Key Characteristics

## 1. Curiosity

- Always learning
- **Driven to explore** new technologies and domains
- Seeking **understanding** rather than quick solutions
- When encountering answers, they dig deeper to ensure comprehension

---

## 2. Collaborativeness

- **Recognizing personal knowledge limits**, actively partner with specialists
- Ask informed questions and approach unfamiliar domains with **humility**
- Understanding there are usually valid reasons behind established practices

---

## 3. User Focus

- Channels curiosity **productively**
- Rather than chasing every trend, prioritize learning that **helps users excel**
- Direct attention to technologies serving project goals

---

## 4. Favour Fundamental Knowledge

- Prioritise **principles and patterns** over tool-specific expertise
- Patterns remain relevant across technology shifts
- Frameworks become obsolete; fundamentals endure

::: {.notes}
**Example:** focus on cloud-native architecture, like auto-scaling heuristics
and multi-region fail-over, rather than focusing on AWS-specific configuration
syntax
:::

---

## 5. Blend of Specialist and Generalist Skills

- Develop **deep knowledge in several domains**
- Typically acquired through:
  - Necessary project work
  - Intellectual curiosity

---

## 6. Sympathy for Related Domains

**"Mechanical sympathy"** — intuitive understanding of adjacent fields

. . .

Examples:

- Database designers understanding UX constraints
- Frontend engineers grasping infrastructure limitations

---

## Why Organisations Need Expert Generalists

- Finding exactly the right kind of specialist limits the candidate pool
- Expert Generalists are particularly valuable at working across the specialist skill boundaries, handling interactions and filling in gaps

  → they can be **the glue** in a team

# Cultivating Expert Generalists

## How to Recognise an Expert Generalist {.smaller}

- How do they approach a particularly challenging situation?
- Do they venture into unfamiliar domains, and how do they get up to speed?
- How do they collaborate with people inside and outside their own organisation or discipline?

## Cultivating Expert Generalists

**Avoid vertical silos:**

- ❌ UI Engineer → Senior UI Engineer → UI Architect

- The implicit message:

  _"Wander outside your lane and your progress stalls."_

::: {.notes}
Even if not explicit, the naming of roles implies vertical silo
:::

---

## Cultivating Expert Generalists

Organizations should **encourage cross-disciplinary experimentation**

**Examples**:

- Business analyst writing code out of curiosity

  → _A PRISM writing code out of curiosity_

- A front-end engineer dabbling in DevOps

  → _An RSE doing some RID work_

- A data engineer trying product analysis

  → _A data steward doing some data science work_

---

## From Tools to Fundamentals

- **The Problem:** Industry focuses on tool expertise rather than underlying principles
- **The Solution:** Emphasize patterns and principles

. . .

Example: Application Development, Data Engineering, and DevOps all share **distributed systems foundations**

. . .

→ It's all just Partitioning, replication and consistency

## But What About the Specialists

- Expert Generalists **enhance** but don't **replace** specialists
- Expert Generalists don't know what they don't know
- **Recommendation**: have at least one specialist for any core technology
- Teams of only generalists succeed slower than **blended teams**
- Teams of only specialists easily miss things outside their specialty

# How is Any of This Relevant to ARC?

## Emerging Silos

- Profession groups
- Subgroups within Collaboration team
- Push for specialisation (?)

. . .

Expert Generalists can be the bridges

::: {.notes}

"Natural evolution" for a growing organisation of ARC's size,
but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to counteract it.

## Not So Different

![](figures/roles.png){fig-align="center"}

# Expert Generalists in the LLM Era

## LLMs will further **increase** Expert Generalist importance {.smaller}

**Lower barriers** to exploring unfamiliar tools

. . .

Expert Generalists with strong fundamentals:

- Ask better questions
- Critically evaluate AI suggestions against architectural patterns
- Avoid blindly accepting unreliable outputs

. . .

Use LLMs to **generate questions**, explain mechanisms, and provide tools

# Conclusion

## Key Takeaways

Expert Generalists represent **sophisticated expertise** combining:

- Learning velocity
- Systems thinking
- Interpersonal skills

. . .

Expert Generalist should be treated as a first-class skill

. . .

Organizations should **deliberately cultivate** this capability
