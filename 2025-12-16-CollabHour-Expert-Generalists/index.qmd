# Introduction

## What is an Expert Generalist?

> Someone who combines **broad knowledge** across multiple domains with **deep expertise** in several areas

- Not a shallow generalist, not a narrow specialist
- **Key abilities:**
  - Learn quickly
  - Recognize fundamental patterns beneath shifting tools
  - Apply insights across disciplines

---

## Beyond T-Shaped

![](https://martinfowler.com/articles/expert-generalist/t-shape.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

::: {.notes}
Traditional model: T-shaped people (one deep skill + broad knowledge)
Expert Generalists are more like **"combs"** or **"paint drips"**
Multiple areas of deep expertise with varying depths
:::

# Six Key Characteristics

## 1. Curiosity

- Always learning
- **Driven to explore** new technologies and domains
- Seeking **understanding** rather than quick solutions
- When encountering answers, they dig deeper to ensure comprehension

---

## 2. Collaborativeness

- **Recognizing personal knowledge limits**, actively partner with specialists
- Ask informed questions and approach unfamiliar domains with **humility**
- Understanding there are usually valid reasons behind established practices

---

## 3. User Focus

- Channels curiosity **productively**
- Rather than chasing every trend, prioritize learning that **helps users excel**
- Direct attention to technologies serving project goals

---

## 4. Favour Fundamental Knowledge

- Prioritise **principles and patterns** over tool-specific expertise
- Patterns remain relevant across technology shifts
- Frameworks become obsolete; fundamentals endure

::: {.notes}
**Example:** focus on cloud-native architecture, like auto-scaling heuristics
and multi-region fail-over, rather than focusing on AWS-specific configuration

## 5. Blend of Specialist and Generalist Skills

- Develop **deep knowledge in several domains**
- Typically acquired through:
  - Necessary project work
  - Intellectual curiosity

---

## 6. Sympathy for Related Domains

**"Mechanical sympathy"** — intuitive understanding of adjacent fields

. . .

Examples:

- Database designers understanding UX constraints
- Frontend engineers grasping infrastructure limitations

# Organizational Benefits

## Breaking Down Silos

Navigate between specialized teams

. . .

Reduce handoff delays

. . .

Enable feature completion across competency boundaries

---

## Knowledge Transfer & Decision-Making

**Knowledge transfer:**

- Cross-domain presence helps specialists develop sympathy for related areas

. . .

**Better decisions:**

- Exposure to multiple tools enables better solution selection
- Avoid defaulting to familiar tools

---

## Complex Problem Solving

System faults often exist in **implicit interactions between technologies**

. . .

Only those seeing the complete picture can diagnose them

. . .

> "An engineer versed in Raft can untangle a Kubernetes control-plane stall that might puzzle several certified admins"

---

## Innovation & Leadership

**Accelerates innovation:**

- Broader perspective reveals patterns invisible to specialists

. . .

**Natural leadership development:**

- Communication skills emerge naturally
- Organizational relationships strengthen
- Credibility grows organically

# Developing Expert Generalists

## From Tools to Fundamentals

**The Problem:** Industry focuses on tool expertise rather than underlying principles

. . .

**The Solution:** Emphasize patterns and principles

. . .

Example: Application Development, Data Engineering, and DevOps all share **distributed systems foundations**

- Partitioning, replication, consistency, consensus

---

## Workshop Model: Building Miniatures

Hands-on training through implementing **simplified versions** of production systems

. . .

### Examples:

- **Build Your Own Kafka** — messaging system with quorum replication
- **Kubernetes from the Inside Out** — controller with reconcile loops
- **ACID on Object Storage** — mini Delta Lake with transaction logs

. . .

Miniatures serve as gateways to understanding real open-source codebases

# The Role of Specialists

## Specialists Are Essential

Expert Generalists **enhance** but don't **replace** specialists

. . .

**Best practices:**

- At least one full-time specialist for core technologies
- Prioritize responsiveness over utilization
- Monitor question-answer latency to prevent bottlenecks

. . .

Teams of pure generalists succeed slower than **blended teams**

---

## Collaboration Attitudes

**From specialists:**

- Eager to share knowledge
- Patient with questions

. . .

**From generalists:**

- Comfortable with ignorance
- Humble when learning new domains
- Thoughtful when introducing different approaches

# Expert Generalists in the LLM Era

## LLMs Amplify Expert Generalist Value

**Lower barriers** to exploring unfamiliar tools

. . .

Expert Generalists with strong fundamentals:

- Ask better questions
- Critically evaluate AI suggestions against architectural patterns
- Avoid blindly accepting unreliable outputs

. . .

Use LLMs to **generate questions**, explain mechanisms, and provide exploratory tools

. . .

**Prediction:** LLMs will further **increase** Expert Generalist importance

# Assessment & Development

## Hiring Expert Generalists

**Move beyond tool trivia questions**

. . .

**Explore:**

- How candidates approached unfamiliar challenges
- How they approached new domains
- How they collaborated across disciplines

. . .

Focus on **learning agility** rather than tool familiarity

---

## Career Progression

Organizations should **encourage cross-disciplinary experimentation**

. . .

**Avoid vertical silos:**

- ❌ UI Engineer → Senior UI Engineer → UI Architect

. . .

**Reward expansion** into adjacent domains

. . .

Treat Expert Generalist as a **"first-class skill"** in career frameworks

---

## Important Challenges

**Assessment difficulty**

- Requires intensive participation from known practitioners
- Harder than certifications and tenure metrics

. . .

**Risk of shallow work**

- Teams need specialist depth in core domains

. . .

**Potential over-commitment**

- Drive to "Get Things Done" can lead to overextension

# Conclusion

## Key Takeaways

Expert Generalists represent **sophisticated expertise** combining:

- Learning velocity
- Systems thinking
- Interpersonal skills

. . .

Their ability to navigate multiple domains while maintaining **principled understanding** makes them invaluable

. . .

Organizations should **deliberately cultivate** this capability
